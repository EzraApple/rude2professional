# rude2professional
Command line script that outputs a more professional version of a rude prompt using OpenAI API. Inspired by a roommate having to tell off a group member on a project over a lack of contribution.

To use the script, you must replace the "YOUR KEY HERE" in main.py with your own API secret key

**Example Input**: "You are lazy and have not been putting enough work into our group project, I need you to shape the hell up and stop messing around"

**Response**: "I kindly request that you increase your level of effort on our group project. I understand that everyone has different levels of motivation, but I believe that if you put more energy into the task at hand, we can achieve a successful outcome. Thank you for your cooperation in this matter."

**Example Input**: "Professor, can you tell me why the hell I got marked down on this essay? I did exactly what was on the damn rubric and somehow got less than full credit"

**Response**: "Professor, I am hoping you can provide me with an explanation as to why my essay was not awarded full credit. I followed the rubric provided and am curious to understand where I may have gone wrong."
